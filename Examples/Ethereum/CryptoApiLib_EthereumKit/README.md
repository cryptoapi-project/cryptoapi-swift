# Using CryptoApiLib library with EthereumKit

The `source code` of the EthereumKit library you can find  by clicking on the [link](https://github.com/D-Technologies/EthereumKit)

### Start using

Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.
```swift
func configCryptoApiLib() -> CryptoAPI {
    // Initialize setting for CryptoApi with your authorization token.
    let apiSettings = Settings(authorizationToken: ExampleConstants.authToken) { configurator in
        configurator.networkType = NetworkType.testnet
    }
    let cryptoApi = CryptoAPI(settings: apiSettings)
    
    return cryptoApi
}
```

The example has an `enum with constants` that can be modified with valid data to run the example.
```swift
enum ExampleConstants {
    static let authToken = "Your token"
    
    static let fromAddress = "sender address"
    static let toAddress = "recipient address"
    static let sendAmount = "100000000000000"
    
    static let mnemonicHex = "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f"
}
```

The following is an example that shows how to `generated address and obtain balance` for it using CryptoApiLib.
```swift
let cryptoApi = configCryptoApiLib()

let mnemonic = Mnemonic.create(entropy: Data(hex: ExampleConstants.mnemonicHex))
let seed = try! Mnemonic.createSeed(mnemonic: mnemonic)
let wallet = try! Wallet(seed: seed, network: .ropsten, debugPrints: true)

let address = wallet.address()

cryptoApi.eth.balance(addresses: [address]) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let addressesBalancesArray):
        for item in addressesBalancesArray {
            print(item.balance)
        }
        
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

Now, before creating a transaction, you need to get a `gas estimate`.
```swift
var estimatedGas: ETHEstimateGasResponseModel?
cryptoApi.eth.estimateGas(fromAddress: ExampleConstants.fromAddress, toAddress: ExampleConstants.toAddress,
                          data: "", value: ExampleConstants.sendAmount) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        estimatedGas = response
        print("nonse: \(response.nonce), gas prise: \(response.gasPrice), estimate: \(response.estimateGas).")
        return
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
        return
    }
}
```

CryptoAPI allows you to send raw transactions, but before that you need to prepare it.
`Creating and sending a transaction` is as follows:
```swift
guard let fee = estimatedGas else {
    return
}
let value = Wei(ExampleConstants.sendAmount)!

let rawTransaction = RawTransaction(value: value, to: address, gasPrice: Int(fee.gasPrice)!, gasLimit: fee.estimateGas, nonce: fee.nonce)
let transactionHash = try! wallet.sign(rawTransaction: rawTransaction)

cryptoApi.eth.sendRaw(transaction: transactionHash) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        print(response.hash)
        return
        
    case .failure(let error):
        fatalError("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
