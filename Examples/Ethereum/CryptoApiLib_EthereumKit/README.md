# Using CryptoApiLib library with EthereumKit

The `source code` of the EthereumKit library you can find  by clicking on the [link](https://github.com/D-Technologies/EthereumKit)

### Start using

Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
```swift
func configCryptoApiLib() -> CryptoAPI {
    // Initialize setting for CryptoApi with your authorization token.
    let apiSettings = Settings(authorizationToken: "Your token") { configurator in
        configurator.networkType = NetworkType.testnet
    }
    let cryptoApi = CryptoAPI(settings: apiSettings)
    
    return cryptoApi
}
```
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.

The following is an example that shows how to `generated address and obtain balance` for it using CryptoApiLib.
```swift
let cryptoApi = configCryptoApiLib()

let mnemonic = Mnemonic.create(entropy: Data(hex: "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f"))
let seed = try! Mnemonic.createSeed(mnemonic: mnemonic)

let wallet: Wallet
do {
    wallet = try Wallet(seed: seed, network: .ropsten, debugPrints: true)
} catch let error {
    fatalError("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}

let address = wallet.address()

cryptoApi.eth.balance(addresses: [address]) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let addressesBalancesArray):
        for item in addressesBalancesArray {
            print(item.balance)
        }
        
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

Now, before creating a transaction, you need to get a `gas estimate`.
```swift
cryptoApi.eth.estimateGas(fromAddress: "from address", toAddress: "to address", data: "", value: "value") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        estimatedGas = response
        print("nonse: \(response.nonce), gas prise: \(response.gasPrice), estimate: \(response.estimateGas).")
        return
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
        return
    }
}
```

CryptoAPI allows you to send raw transactions, but before that you need to prepare it.
`Creating and sending a transaction` is as follows:
```swift
guard let fee = estimatedGas else {
    return
}
guard let value = try? Converter.toWei(ether: "0.0001") else {
    print("Invalid transaction value")
    return
}

let rawTransaction = RawTransaction(value: value, to: address, 
                                    gasPrice: Int(fee.gasPrice)!, 
                                    gasLimit: fee.estimateGas, nonce: fee.nonce)

let transactionHash: String
do {
    transactionHash = try wallet.sign(rawTransaction: rawTransaction)
} catch let error {
    fatalError("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}

cryptoApi.eth.sendRaw(transaction: transactionHash) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        print(response.hash)
        return
        
    case .failure(let error):
        fatalError("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
