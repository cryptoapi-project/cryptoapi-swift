# Using CryptoApiLib library with [EthereumKit](https://github.com/D-Technologies/EthereumKit)

### Get started

Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.
```swift
func configCryptoApiLib() -> CryptoAPI {
    // Initialize setting for CryptoApi with your authorization token.
    let apiSettings = Settings(authorizationToken: ExampleConstants.authToken) { configurator in
        configurator.networkType = NetworkType.testnet
    }
    let cryptoApi = CryptoAPI(settings: apiSettings)
    
    return cryptoApi
}
```
### Constanst
The example has an `enum with constants` that can be modified with valid data to run the example.
```swift
enum ExampleConstants {
    static let authToken = "Your token"
    
    static let fromAddress = "sender address"
    static let toAddress = "recipient address"
    static let sendAmount = "100000000000000"
    
    static let mnemonicHex = "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f"
}
```
### Generate address. Get balance.
The following is an example that shows how to `generated address and obtain balance` for it using CryptoApiLib.
```swift
let cryptoApi = configCryptoApiLib()

let mnemonic = Mnemonic.create(entropy: Data(hex: ExampleConstants.mnemonicHex))
let seed = try! Mnemonic.createSeed(mnemonic: mnemonic)
let wallet = try! Wallet(seed: seed, network: .private(chainID: 4, testUse: true), debugPrints: true)

let address = wallet.address()

cryptoApi.eth.balance(addresses: [address]) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let addressesBalancesArray):
        for item in addressesBalancesArray {
            print("Balance \(item.balance) wei")
        }
        
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```
### Estimate nonce, gas price and gas limit
Now, before creating a transaction, you need to get a `gas estimate`.
```swift
cryptoApi.eth.estimateGas(fromAddress: ExampleConstants.fromAddress, toAddress: ExampleConstants.toAddress, data: "", value: ExampleConstants.sendAmount) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        print("nonse: \(response.nonce), gas prise: \(response.gasPrice), estimate: \(response.estimateGas).")
        return
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
        return
    }
}
```
### Create and Send trantaction
CryptoAPI allows you to send raw transactions, but before that you need to prepare it.
`Creating and sending a transaction` is as follows:
```swift
let value = Wei(ExampleConstants.sendAmount)!

let rawTransaction = RawTransaction(
    value: value,
    to: ExampleConstants.toAddress,
    gasPrice: Int(response.gasPrice)!,
    gasLimit: response.estimateGas,
    nonce: response.nonce
)
let transactionHash = try! wallet.sign(rawTransaction: rawTransaction)

cryptoApi.eth.sendRaw(transaction: transactionHash) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        print(response.hash)
        return
        
    case .failure(let error):
        fatalError("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
