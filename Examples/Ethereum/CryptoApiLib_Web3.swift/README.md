# Using CryptoApiLib library with Web3.swift

The `source code` of the EthereumKit library you can find  by clicking on the [link](https://github.com/Boilertalk/Web3.swift)

### Start using

Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.
```swift
func configCryptoApiLib() -> CryptoAPI {
    // Initialize setting for CryptoApi with your authorization token.
    let apiSettings = Settings(authorizationToken: "Your token") { configurator in
        configurator.networkType = NetworkType.testnet
    }
    let cryptoApi = CryptoAPI(settings: apiSettings)
    
    return cryptoApi
}
```

The example has an `enum with constants` that can be modified with valid data to run the example.
```swift
enum ExampleConstants {
    static let authToken = "Your authorization token"
    
    static let toAddress = "recipient address"
    static let sendAmount = "1000000000000000000"
    
    static let privateKey = "0xa26da69ed1df3ba4bb2a231d506b711eace012f1bd2571dfbfff9650b03375af"
}
```

The following is an example that shows how to `generated address and obtain balance` for it using CryptoApiLib.
```swift
let cryptoApi = configCryptoApiLib()

let privateKey = try! EthereumPrivateKey(hexPrivateKey: "0xa26da69ed1df3ba4bb2a231d506b711eace012f1bd2571dfbfff9650b03375af")
let address = privateKey.address.hex(eip55: true)
print(address)

cryptoApi.eth.balance(addresses: [address]) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let addressesBalancesArray):
        for item in addressesBalancesArray {
            print(item.balance)
        }
    
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

Now, before creating a transaction, you need to get a `gas estimate`. After that, we can `build the raw transaction and send` it using CryptoApiLib.
```swift
var estimatedGas: ETHEstimateGasResponseModel?

cryptoApi.eth.estimateGas(fromAddress: privateKey.address.hex(eip55: true), 
                            toAddress: privateKey.address.hex(eip55: true), 
                            data: "", value: "1000000000000000000") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        estimatedGas = response
        print("nonse: \(response.nonce), gas prise: \(response.gasPrice), estimate: \(response.estimateGas).")
        
        let nonce = EthereumQuantity(quantity: BigUInt(estimatedGas!.nonce))
        let gasPrice = EthereumQuantity(quantity: try! BigUInt(estimatedGas!.gasPrice))
        let gasLimit = EthereumQuantity(quantity: BigUInt(estimatedGas!.estimateGas))
        let value = EthereumQuantity(quantity: 1.eth)
        guard let toAddress = try? EthereumAddress(hex: "to addres hex", eip55: true) else {
            return
        }
        
        // transaction creation
        let transaction = EthereumTransaction(nonce: nonce, gasPrice: gasPrice, 
                                                gas: gasLimit, from: privateKey.address,
                                                to: toAddress, value: value)
        
        // sign transaction with your private key
        guard let signedTransaction = try? transaction.sign(with: privateKey) else {
            return
        }
        
        // send raw transaction by transaction hash
        cryptoApi.eth.sendRaw(transaction: signedTransaction.data.hex()) { result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let txResponse):
                print(txResponse.hash)
            case .failure(let error):
                print(error.localizedDescription)
                return
            }
        }
        
        return
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
        return
    }
}
```
