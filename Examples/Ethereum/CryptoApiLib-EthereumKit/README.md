# Using CryptoApiLib library with [EthereumKit](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/ethereum-kit-ios)

### Get started

Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.
```swift
func configCryptoApiLib() -> CryptoAPI {
    // Initialize setting for CryptoApi with your authorization token.
    let apiSettings = Settings(authorizationToken: ExampleConstants.authToken) { configurator in
        configurator.networkType = NetworkType.testnet
    }
    let cryptoApi = CryptoAPI(settings: apiSettings)
    
    return cryptoApi
}
```

```swift
func configEthereumKit() -> Kit {
    // Initialize setting for EthereumKit with your parametrs.
    let ethereumKit = try! Kit.instance(
        words: ExampleConstants.words,
        syncMode: .api,
        rpcApi: .incubed,
        etherscanApiKey: "",
        walletId: "testWallet"
    )
    
    ethereumKit.start()
    
    return ethereumKit
}
```

### Constanst
The example has an `enum with constants` that can be modified with valid data to run the example.
```swift
enum ExampleConstants {
    static let authToken = "Your token"
    
    static let fromAddress = "sender address"
    static let toAddress = "recipient address"
    static let sendAmount = "100000000000000"
    
    static let mnemonicHex = "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f"
    static let words = ["example","array", "of", "your", "brainkey", "words"]
}
```
### Generate address. Get balance.
The following is an example that shows how to `generated address and obtain balance` for it using CryptoApiLib.
```swift
let cryptoApi = configCryptoApiLib()
let kit = configEthereumKit()

let address = kit.address.description

// get generated address
cryptoApi.eth.balance(addresses: [address]) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let addressesBalancesArray):
        for item in addressesBalancesArray {
            print("Balance \(item.balance) wei")
        }

    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```
### Estimate nonce, gas price and gas limit
Now, before creating a transaction, you need to get a `gas estimate`.
```swift
// estimate gas for transaction
cryptoApi.eth.estimateGas(fromAddress: ExampleConstants.fromAddress, toAddress: ExampleConstants.toAddress, data: "", value: ExampleConstants.sendAmount) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        print("nonse: \(response.nonce), gas prise: \(response.gasPrice), estimate: \(response.estimateGas).")

        // build transaction and get transaction hash
        self.createTransaction(kit: kit) { hash in
            // send buided transaction
            self.sendRawTransaction(cryptoApi: cryptoApi, transactionHash: hash)
        }
        
        return
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
        return
    }
}
```
### Create and Send trantaction
CryptoAPI allows you to send raw transactions, but before that you need to prepare it.
`Creating and sending a transaction` is as follows:
```swift
let amount = BigUInt(stringLiteral: ExampleConstants.sendAmount)
let address = try! Address(hex: "0x73eb56f175916bd17b97379c1fdb5af1b6a82c84")

kit
    .sendSingle(address: address, value: amount, gasPrice: 50_000_000_000, gasLimit: 1_000_000_000_000)
    .subscribe(onSuccess: { transaction in
        print("Transcation hash: \(transaction.transaction.hash.hex)")
        comletion(transaction.transaction.hash.hex)
        // sendSingle returns FullTransaction object which contains transaction, receiptWithLogs and internalTransactions
    })

cryptoApi.eth.sendRaw(transaction: transactionHash) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        print(response.hash)
        return

    case .failure(let error):
        fatalError("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
