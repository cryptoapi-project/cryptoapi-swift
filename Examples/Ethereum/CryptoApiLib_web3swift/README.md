# Using CryptoApiLib library with web3swift

The `source code` of the EthereumKit library you can find  by clicking on the [link](https://cocoapods.org/pods/web3swift)

### Start using

Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
```
func configCryptoApiLib() -> CryptoAPI {
    // Initialize setting for CryptoApi with your authorization token.
    let apiSettings = Settings(authorizationToken: "Your token") { configurator in
        configurator.networkType = NetworkType.testnet
    }
    let cryptoApi = CryptoAPI(settings: apiSettings)
    
    return cryptoApi
}
```
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.

The following is an example that shows how to `generated address and obtain balance` for it using CryptoApiLib.
```
let cryptoApi = configCryptoApiLib()
       
let mnemonicString = "your mnemonic words"

let keystore = try! BIP32Keystore(mnemonics: mnemonicString,
                                  password: "",
                                  mnemonicsPassword: "",
                                  language: .english)!
let keystoreManager = KeystoreManager([keystore])
let web = web3(provider: InfuraProvider(.Rinkeby)!)
web.addKeystoreManager(keystoreManager)

let account = try! web.wallet.getAccounts().first!
let address = keystore.addresses!.first!.address

cryptoApi.eth.balance(addresses: [address]) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let addressesBalancesArray):
        for item in addressesBalancesArray {
            print(item.balance)
        }
        
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

Now, before creating a transaction, you need to get a `gas estimate`.
```
let toAddress = "to address"
let value = "10000"
var estimatedGas: ETHEstimateGasResponseModel?
cryptoApi.eth.estimateGas(fromAddress: address, toAddress: toAddress, data: "", value: value) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        estimatedGas = response
        print("nonse: \(response.nonce), gas prise: \(response.gasPrice), estimate: \(response.estimateGas).")
        return
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
        return
    }
}
```

CryptoAPI allows you to send raw transactions, but before that you need to prepare it.
`Creating and sending a transaction` is as follows:
```
guard let ethToAddress = EthereumAddress(toAddress) else {
    print("Invalid address")
    return
}

let nonce = BigUInt(fee.nonce)
let gasLimit = BigUInt(fee.estimateGas)
guard let intTransactionValue = BigUInt(value), let gasPrice = BigUInt(fee.gasPrice) else {
    return
}
let v = BigUInt(0)
let r = BigUInt(0)
let s = BigUInt(0)

// transaction creation
var transaction = EthereumTransaction(nonce: nonce, gasPrice: gasPrice, gasLimit: gasLimit, 
                                        to: ethToAddress, value: intTransactionValue, data: Data(), 
                                        v: v, 
                                        r: r, 
                                        s: s)
transaction.UNSAFE_setChainID(BigUInt(4)) // "4" for Rinkeby provider

// transaction signing
try! Web3Signer.signTX(transaction: &transaction, keystore: keystoreManager, account: account, password: "")
guard let transactionHash = transaction.encode()?.toHexString() else {
    return
}

// transaction sending
cryptoApi.eth.sendRaw(transaction: transactionHash) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        print(response.hash)
        
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```
